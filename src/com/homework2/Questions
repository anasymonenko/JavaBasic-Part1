5.	The following code creates one array and one string object. How many references to those objects exist after the code executes? Is either object eligible for garbage collection?
...
String[] students = new String[10];
String studentName = "Peter Parker";
students[0] = studentName;
studentName = null;
...

There is one reference to the students array and that array has one reference to the "Peter Parker" string.
These objects are not eligible for garbage collection.

6.	How does a program destroy an object that it creates?

The program does not destroy objects. The garbage collector is used instead.
The main purpose of garbage collection is to free heap memory by destroying objects that do not contain a reference.
